French startup Aircall just raised a $2.75 million round led by Balderton Capital, with FundersClub and business angels also participating. As a reminder, Aircall was part of our Battlefield competition at Disrupt SF 2015, started at eFounders and attended 500 Startups’ acceleration program. It plans to reinvent how phone customer support works.

Instead of relying on aging solutions, Aircall lets you deploy a business phone system in just a few minutes. It’s a software-as-a-service approach, so you won’t need to install anything on your servers or switch to new desk phones. Your customer support team just needs to install the Aircall app on their computer and phone.

Aircall is packed with useful features making your customer support team much more efficient. For instance, you can program cascading calls — if the first customer support representative doesn’t answer, the call will be transferred to the next one. Aircall also provides integrations with all the usual suspects — Salesforce, Zendesk, Slack and Pipedrive.

Aircall also lets you generate international phone numbers. For instance, even if your team is based in Paris, they can have a Spanish and a Portuguese phone number so that clients in these countries can call a local number.

It seems to be working as the company now has 800 customers, such as Uber and Deliveroo. And it’s not just customer support now. Sales teams and marketing teams also use Aircall. On average, 7 to 10 people are using Aircall per company. Uber and Deliveroo are on the bigger end of the spectrum (20 to 50 users), but Aircall wants to get more clients of this size.

With today’s funding round, the company plans to hire in Paris and San Francisco. It also plans to work on the product. A major iOS update is on the way, and the Android app should be live in a couple of months.
